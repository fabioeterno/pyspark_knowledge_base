# pyspark_knowledge_base
In this repository I collect the basic knowledge for pyspark programming in order to create distributed programming applications.

All the material is based on the course "Distributed architectures for big data processing and analytics" of Politecnico di Torino (year 2020-2021).

For further clarification you can refer to the following webpage:
